Targeted audience:
Who are we interested in targeting as our audience?
	1. Biogeographers interested in regionalization
	2. Community ecologists interested in using these methods to delineate communities
	3. 
	4. 

Targeted journal:
	1. Ecography? 
		From Ecography website - "ECOGRAPHY publishes papers focused on broad spatial and temporal patterns, particularly studies of population and community ecology, macroecology, biogeography, and ecological conservation. Studies in ecological genetics and historical ecology are welcomed in the context of explaining contemporary ecological patterns. Manuscripts are expected to address general principles in ecology, though they may do so using a specific model system if this frames the problem relative to a generalised ecological issue."

		"Review & synthesis papers provide a critical assessment of the literature with emphasis on current topics in which rapid and significant advances are occurring. Items in this category should be more focused than the broad, topical reviews typically published elsewhere, developing a synthesis that inspires new hypotheses or new methods. Contributions in this category will be solicited by the editors. However, unsolicited submissions will also be considered and sent for pre-submission assessment by Review & Synthesis editors."

Rationalization:

A. General: Why bother? Why should should you and I spend our time doing this? What does our review offer that others don't?

	1. This method has been shows to be effective with certain animal groups (Holt et al., 2014).
	2. Incorporates the evolutionary history of the organisms, leading to biologically meaningful regions.
	3. A fairly objective approach
	4. 
	5.

B. General: Why is it important and timely?
	1. An increasing number of studies of this sort
	2. More availability of large scale data and phylogenies
	3. Global change - how will regions change in location in response
	4. 
	5.

Objectives:

A. To assess the utility of including phylogenetic information into regionalization of biomes/ecoregions
	1. What do you compare against?
	2. What do the results of previous studies show (this would be a little bit of a review)
		a. When is it successful, when isn't it?
		b. Is success related to taxonomic / geographical scale?
		c. Is success related to the specific methods used?
B. Provide recommendations on when to use phylogenetic regionalization verses traditional and what methods to follow.

Scope:

	1. Which organisms do we focus on and why?
	2. Do we include a comparison with traditional beta diversity studies?

_______________________________________________________________________


Considerations:

	1. Do we consider using our own data to make our points?
		a. If so - how?
	2. Would simulations be useful here?
		a. If so - what would be be saying with them?

Outline:


A. Introduction (how long do we make this?)
	1. Why do this?
	2. Historical context
		a. Mention differing approaches
	3. How do we do this?
		a. Types of data used in phylogenetic regionalization
	4. Why is it timely?
	5. Introduce objectives and scope
	6. What does it tell us that traditional approaches lack?

B. Approaches
	1. Beta diversity
		a. History
		b. Utility
	1. Phylogentic beta diversity
		a. Outline analytical framework (include Figure)
		b. Describe different approaches: clustering, hierarchical, etc.
	3. Other approaches


C. Comparison of effectiveness of phylogenetic regionalization verses other methods
	1. How do we assess how effective it is?
	2. What have previous studies shown? Where are we at?
		a. Include a table here

D. Suggestions
	1. When do we recommend including phylogenetic information? When don't we recommend using it?
		a. Provide a strong rationalization.
		b. A second table could be useful here
	2. Suggestions for best practices
		a. Statistical methods/approaches
		b. Phylogenies used
		c. Scale

E. Ways forward
	1. Integrating landscape community phylogenomics
	2. Landscape genomics
